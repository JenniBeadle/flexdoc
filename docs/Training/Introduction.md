title: FLEx video course version 8.3
---

## Introduction

This course gives you a basic understanding of how to use FieldWorks Language Explorer (**F**ieldWorks **L**anguage **Ex**plorer**) as a lexicography tool (i.e. a tool for dictionary creation and language analysis). FLEx is part of a software package (called FieldWorks) that is used for linguistic and cultural data management.

This course is based on the "Demo Videos" which are available in the software under the "Help" menu. At this point, the videos are only available in English. But the text of this course will assist you to follow the ideas presented in the videos, even if you do not understand English. It is possible to watch the videos by following this text, or just follow the text of this document and consult the video if you have any questions.

This course does not provide you with data to enter. You are encouraged to use your own language input when practicing the techniques presented here. If you do not have any input, you can practice with your native language or with the Sena 3 sample project (included in the default installation).

## Course objectives

At the end of this course you should be able to :

- Open and configure the FLEx desktop
- Sort, filter and search data
- Create and modify entries in the lexicon
- Work with homographs, genders and inflectional features
- Add example sentences and search for sentences in the text corpus
- Work with affixes and allomorphs
- Creating lexical relationships and complex forms (as variants)
- Use the categorized entry
- Editing block entries
- Analyse interlinear texts with morpheme splitting
- Use a concordance

## Installation and Initial Configuration

Normally the installation and configuration of FLEx is done with the help of the trainer. The installation files are available on the Internet at <http://fieldworks.sil.org/download/>. Make sure you install FieldWorks version 7+[^1]. With Windows 7, use the minimal installation (B). With other versions of Windows, use the full installation (A). To follow this course, it is also recommended to install the "Demo Videos", available at <http://fieldworks.sil.org/download/movies/>.

[^1]: This version is currently available at <http://fieldworks.sil.org/download/beta/>, but soon version 7 will be available on the main path noted above.

If you already have an older installation of FieldWorks, when you install FieldWorks 7, you will have the option to migrate older projects to the new format. To migrate projects later, use the File \> Project Management \> Restore Project command.

If you don't have a project yet, create a project using the File \> New FieldWorks Project command. Be especially careful when selecting or creating the language and writing system.

You can change the interface language from English to French by using the Tools \> Options \> Interface command and selecting "French" as the "User interface language".
