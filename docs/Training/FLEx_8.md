## FLEx Session – Introduction

### Overview

FLEx (or Language Explorer, as it is really called) is one program in a suite of programs to help language teams manage language and cultural data, called FieldWorks. Unlike previous programs for these tasks, FieldWorks has built-in knowledge about the kinds of data that linguists need to store. FLEx is designed specifically to help linguists build a dictionary and develop their understanding of the grammar, as they use it to analyse and interlinearize texts.

There is further information about FieldWorks at [www.sil.org/computing/fieldworks/](http://www.sil.org/computing/fieldworks/). Development of FieldWorks is ongoing. These teaching sessions are based upon version 8.

Some key points:

-   It is best to have the participants spend part of the workshop working on their own language projects, using the skills they are learning in the teaching session.
-   After the participants have done the exercises, it is best to go over the exercises with the participants by having one of them telling what they did and you doing it.
-   This material is based upon version 8 of FLEx.

## Objectives

-   To be able to create and edit a lexicon.
-   To be able to generate a dictionary from the lexicon.
-   To be able to interlinearize text.
-   To be able to chart interlinearized text.
-   To be able to parse text.
-   To be able to do collaboration.

## Affixes

An affix is a morpheme (a part of a word) that cannot stand alone and must be attached to a root. Prefixes occur before the root, suffixes after the root, infixes in the middle of the root. Inflectional affixes often indicate how the word functions in the grammar. Derivational affixes usually change the grammatical category (part of speech) of the root or change the meaning in some important way.

# FLEx Session - Text Charting

## Objectives

-   To be able generate a text chart from a given text

## Text Charting

Discourse analysis has as its focus linguistic phenomenon at greater than word level. This means that the structure of entire text is of interest.

One of the primary tools that a linguist uses to answer these questions is the discourse chart. One of the primary types of chart is the Text Chart. The Text Chart is made by putting the text in a table so that generally each clause is on a separate line with the various phrases in the clause spread out to their own columns. This allows the linguist to see at a glance if certain verb tenses or aspects entail "different" behavior elsewhere in the clause, or if certain particles always show up at a certain point in a story, but not in others, etc. It also makes it easy to see if something (e.g. a Noun Phrase) occurs out of its "normal" position.

### How to generate a chart from text?

First, we will create a new project for this exercise (normally you would use your existing project)

1.  On the **File** menu, click **New FieldsWorks Project**.

    The **New FieldsWorks Project** dialog box appears.

    1.  In the **Name the project** area, in the **Vernacular language writing system** area, select **Ekoti**. If, necessary, you may need to define a new writing system call **Ekoti**. In the **Analysis language writing system area**, select **English**. Then Click **OK**.

        The project is created.

### 2. Copy the text to baseline

1.  Click **Text & Words**.
    1.  If necessary, create a new text.
        1.  Click **Info** tab. In the **Title** boxes, type **Hantisi** and **Story,**
            1.  Click **Baseline** tab. Copy first section from Ekoti Text.rtf to the baseline.

### 3. Interlinearize the first sections of the text

Third, interlinearize the first sections of the text using Ekoti Chart.rtf as a guide.

1.  On the **Tools** menu, point to **Configure** and click **Interlinear**. In the **Displayed Item** box, select **Word,** **Word Gloss** and **Free translation**.
    1.  Click **Gloss** tab. Then gloss the displayed text.
        1.  Click the word for which you will specify a word gloss.

            The word appears in a word focus box.

            1.  In the **Word Gloss** line, do one of the following:
-   Click the white box, and then enter a new gloss or edit the existing gloss.
-   Click the down arrow, if present, and then select an existing gloss, or select **New word gloss**.
-   If you select **New word gloss**, the **Word Gloss** line(s) clears (white text box becomes empty) so you can enter a new gloss.
    1.  To approve the gloss, enter the gloss and click the green check icon or press **Enter**.
        1.  The Word Gloss down arrow only occurs when the word has one or more analyses and the current analysis in use by the focus box has one or more word gloss. You can select one of those glosses. You can click the down arrow in the Word line, select New word gloss, and then enter a new gloss in the **Word Gloss** line. The Word Gloss down arrow list will contain the selectable command "\<Empty\>" after you have left the word with the Word Gloss line empty and then return to that word. This allows you to examine and close the menu while retaining an empty Word Gloss line.

            If you specify a different word gloss such that the previous word gloss is no longer referenced by the current analysis, the previous word gloss will be automatically removed from the Word Gloss list.

            1.  **To combine two words into one phrase, click on the chain link icon between the two words.**
            2.  To add the free translation, click on the **Free** text box and enter the free translation.
            3.  In **Texts & Words**, these commands may also be available:
-   Approve and Move Next (Green check icon)

    This approves the analysis in the word focus box and moves the focus to the next word or phrase. Equivalent: Press **Enter**.

-   Approve Throughout this Text (Green check plus icon\_

    This approves the analysis in the word focus box for all instances of the same analysis in the current text, and moves the focus to next word or phrase. Equivalent: Press **Ctrl+E**.

-   Approve and Jump to Next Incomplete

    This approves the analysis in the word focus box and jumps to the next word or phrase with a suggested or incomplete analysis. Equivalent: Press **Ctrl+J.**

-   Approve and Stay

    This approves the analysis in the word focus box and keeps the focus on the same word or phrase. Equivalent: Press **Ctrl+S.**

### 4. Chart the first sections

Fourth, chart the first sections of the text using Ekoti Chart.rtf as a guide.

1.  Click **Text Chart** tab. Then process the text at the bottom of the window, putting them in the appropriate columns.
    1.  To insert words into the chart:
-   In a **Text Chart** tab, vernacular words and their word glosses appear in the bottom pane of this tab. The first displayed word or phrase is selected. If appropriate, select one or more subsequent words that you want to insert into the chart into the same row (clause) and column.
