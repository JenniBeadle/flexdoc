(2 - Pane layout in Fieldworks)

Often vews contain a quick-reading pane and an editing pane. The quick view (or browse) pane on the left shows several entries while the edit pane on the right allows the user to work on an entry in detail. The entry selected in the left pane is displayed in detail in the right pane. You can minimize a pane by dragging the dividing line between the left and right panes.
