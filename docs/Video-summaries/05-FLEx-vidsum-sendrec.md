The send/receive feature of FLEx allows different people working on different computers to all make edits to the same FLEx database. It can be done via the Internet, USB key, ChorusHub. Even if you are the only user it can be useful to help you easily work on more than one computer e.g. a desktop at work and a laptop at home. 

Send/Receive using the Internet also provides and off-site back of you entire project. 

Before you begin with Send/Receive
1. Choose which location you will use
- USB Flash Drive
- Internet
- Chorus Hub
2. If there are copies on various computers.  
Identify the most up-to-date and start the Send/Receive with that version.

[**Send Project for the First time (Send/Receive 2)**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/111737712) (4:31)

There are several one-off steps to setting up Send/Receive for the very first time.

*Internet access*
For this example, there is only one user so there is only one live copy of the project. 

1. Visit the website of the Internet server
**languagedepot.org**
  *The instructions are written on the initial page of the website*.
a. Setup user account on language depot.
- Click register
- Fill-in the fields
 *The log-in screen is displayed, with a message about an email to activate the account.*
If you haven't received the email. Contact the site administrators  and they will activate it for you.
b. Request the creation of a special project for you FLEx project on the language depot site. 
You should do this for each FLEx project you want to send/receive.
- Wait for a response saying that the project has been created.

2. Send the project for the first time.
- in FLEx, from the Send/Receive menu, choose **Send this Project for the first time..**
:::tip
This command only needs to be used for the very first time.
:::
 *Initially we see a long set of instructions and warning*.
- since this is the only copy, click **OK (I have the master project.)**

3. Enter setting for Send/Receive over the Internet
- Click the Settings link (at bottom right)
- Enter the Project ID (from email from languagedepot administrator)
- Enter the log-in details (that you created on the languagedepot site)

  *The Internet button becomes enabled*

4. Send/receive
- Click **Internet** 
 *The progress is shown**
 *When complete a jingle is heard and a check mark is displayed at the top of the screen*.
:::info
This project is now ready on this computer for ongoing syncing with send/receive. And someone else on another computer can receive the project and join in the work.

 :::caution

[**Add Member to a Project (Send/Receive 3)**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/111737711) (1:59)
Another user can now receive the project if they use the same languagedepot logon details the send/receive. However it may be a good idea to add a second account for other team members so that not everyone has access to the admin. You don't need to have separate accounts for each person.

Create another account
- Go to the languagedepot.org site
- Click Register
- Fill-in the fields

After it has been created and verified you need to log back in as administrator to add the new user as a contributor.
