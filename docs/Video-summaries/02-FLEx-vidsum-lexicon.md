### 23 Specifying the Components of Complex Forms (Making Subentries){#23}
[**23 FLEx Specifying the Components of Complex Forms (Making Subentries)**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/116264102) (1:44)


In this version of FLEx, the way you specify complex forms and variants has changed. The new fields provide more flexibility but may seem slightly more complicated. Improvements are needed in the future.

#### How to specify a complex form
If a lexeme contains more than one morpheme you can specify what its components are.

#### Characteristics of the components of a complex form

In the lexicon area, the Edit lexicon view

- Show the entry to edit.
- In the components field, click the ellipsis button (far right) 
check [](media/12141d8dd8ad51c87c69547387d7d168.png)

- Search for one of the components.
- If the entry is found you can click **OK**.
- You can add another component by repeating the action.
- If the entry was not found, you can add it by clicking on **Create**

check [](media/88ea7cb50b495854a21a90dc5a54cd8e.png)

   *More fields are added to the entry.*

- Click in the field **Complex form type**
- Check the desired type (or add as needed).
- Click **OK**

check [](media/3dd05645bd44a910333d0e7f082bc3cc.png)

:::tip **Note** 
You don't have to add an entry for all the derivatives that are possible, only those whose component meanings are not predictable.
:::

### 24 Add a Variant{#24}
[**24 FLEx Add a Variant**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/116264104) (1:07)

*In the lexicon area, lexicon edit view*
-  Go to the entry
-  Scroll down and click in the Variants section
  *The Insert Variant command is displayed*.
-  Click the Insert Variant link  
  *The Find Variant dialog is displayed*.

- Type in the form of the variant
  *Existing entries are listed*.
- Choose an existing entry or click **Create**
  *The variant is added*.
- Set the variant type(s).
- Turn off the "Show Minor Entry" as necessary.
:::tip
You can turn off the "Show Minor Entry" if the entries would be near each other in the dictionary.
::

### 25 Specifying a Complex Form is also a Variant (1:01){#25}
[**25 FLEx Specifying a Complex Form is also a Variant**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/116266119) (1:01)

The new way we specify variants and complex forms, allows us to have an entry marked up as both.

- Go to the entry which has been set up as a complex entry.
- Click on the **Entry** menu
- Choose **Lexeme Form is a variant**  
   *Several fields are added*.

- Click the ellipsis icon 
  *The Choose lexical sense or entry dialog is displayed*.
- Type the lexical entry
- Click **OK**

:::tip
In dictionary view it will be treated primarily as a variant.
:::

### 26 Displaying Complex Forms in Dictionary View{#26}
[**26 Displaying Complex Forms in Dictionary View**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/118855078) (1:48)

Entries which are complex forms have an additional field which allows you to reduce where the entry is displayed in dictionary views.
This field is called "Show Subentry under" since it controls which entry this appears under as a sub-entry in root-based view.

The entries in **Show Subentry under** have to be components.

#### Select a component
- Right-click on the component.
  *A menu is displayed*
- Select **Show subentry under this component**.

#### Alternatively
- Click on the button on the right
  *The choose where to show subentry" dialog is displayed*.

#### Configure dictionary

*In the lexicon area, lexicon edit view*

-   On the **Tools** menu choose **Configure Dictionary**
-   Select **Root-based**
-   Click **OK**

**![](media/0a1635d4b6c768677742b9bc71f91d7d.png)**

Stem-based = separate entries  
Root-based = sub-entries

### 27 Using Collect Words{#27}
[**27 Using Collect Words (Formerly Categorized Entry)**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/116266123) (3:11)

Using Collect Words (formerly Categorised entry) is a special tool for efficiently entering words which were elicited in semantic domains at a workshop. (see the Dictionary Development Process on the sil.org website).

#### Entering words by semantic domain

*In the lexicon area, Collect Words view*

-   Select the desired semantic domain in the centre pane (e.g. 2.1.1. Head)
-   In the upper right pane you can configure it to hide the questions and answers to save space
-   In the lower right pane enter words for the selected semantic domain.  
    *[While you enter them Language Explorer makes new entries]*
-   Using the keyboard, type enter for a new row
-   Then type the word then press tab then type the definition.

    ![](media/ae0cebd4f771e167637b0676446fbd99.png)

    *The new entry created contains the information entered: i.e. lexeme form, definition and semantic domain (as shown above).*

-   If a matching entry is found, Language explorer just adds the semantic domain to the entry.
-   If the definition does not match, then Language Explorer adds a second sense with the new domain.

:::tip
In this way Language Explorer does not add duplicates when you use categorised entry. You will still need to review the entries made after using Collect Words. But you should always check the entries made after using Collect Words.
