[**42 Using the Gloss Tab and Configuring Interlinear**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/191684692) (:57)

Like the Analyse tab the Gloss tab provides an interlinear view. But it is preconfigured for adding word glosses, word categories and free translations. You can change it by using the Tools-Configure Interlinear and make it either simpler or more complicated.

In the Gloss or Analysis tab, you can change the line spacing configuration.

#### Modify the configuration
- In the **Tools** menu, choose **Configure** and then ***Interlinear**. *The Interlinear configuration dialog box is displayed.

#### Delete lines
- Click on the line in the list of displayed lines.
- Click **Delete**.
- Click **OK**.

### 44 Using the parser (3:27) {#44}
[**44 Using Parser**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/191684687) (3:27)

Language Explorer also has a morphological parser which is controlled by options in the parser menu. The parser attempts to suggest or predict analyses based on the entries in the lexicon and the rules and **facts??** in the grammar area. If you don’t use the parser you will still see analyses that you have entered previously suggested for you in blue. These blue suggestions are limited to words you have analysed previously.

In contrast the morphological parser can suggest analyses for words you have not encountered before. And it can make a suggestion/prediction as long as it can find the morphemes in the lexicon and the grammar rules allow it.

### Start the parser

*In the Text and Words area*, *Interlinear view and analyse tab*

-   From the parser menu choose Parse all words
-   You can follow the parser’s progress on the status bar
-   *The screen does not update*. *So go to the list area and return*.
-   Now you can see suggestions made by the parser highlighted in orange.

    **![](media/653dcadf4f1a34ef9fa52c854084a825.png)**

-   Parser suggestions do not include a word gloss or word category
-   You can edit and approve these suggestions as usual.

:::tip

The quality and quantity of the parser's suggestions depend entirely on your lexicon and grammar.
:::


### 45 Words Analyses View{#45}
[**45 Word Analyses View**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/191684686) (1:08)

All the words that are in texts are listed in the Words Analyses view. There is a column which shows how many occurrences there are in the entire text corpus. You can also show other columns including the number of analyses you have approved for each word and the number of analyses that the parser has predicated for each word. This view is useful for reviewing the various analyses for each word.

Analyses that are suggested by the parser are first put in the user opinion unknown section since it is only an analysis candidate. You can state that you approve this analysis.

#### Approve an analysis candidate (as suggested by the parser)

*In the Text and Words area*, *Word analyses view*

-   Browse the word to be analysed
-   In the analysis pane find the analysis candidate
-   Click on the Analysis candidate menu button
-   Choose User Opinion, then approve

![](media/bcd4e748107797df64312120d8354937.png)

  *It is then moved up into the user approved analyses section*.


### 46 Assigning analyses{#46}
[**46 Assign Analyses**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/118855079) (1:03)

The Word Analyses view has a tool which allows you to assign analyses to any number of occurrences in texts. By using the assign analysis tool I can specify which analysis is the right one for these other occurrences that I haven’t worked on in the texts.

*In the Text and Words area*, *Word analyses view*

-   Browse for the word to be analysed
-   Click on the Assign Analysis command (at the top right of the window)

    ![](media/636328dc08007fdc9019fdb50e148726.png)

    *The Analysis Usage dialog is displayed*.

    ![](media/af8b7315d10c9d036c195a8bb30d5ab9.png)

-   Select the occurrences that relate to one of the analysis.
-   Click on the word gloss for the desired analysis
-   Click the **Assign** button.

-   Select the occurrences that relate to the next analysis
-   Click on the word gloss for the analysis
-   Click the **Assign** button.
-   Click **Close**

:::tip

This can help you work efficiently.

### Adding an inflectional template
[**47 Adding an Inflection Template**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/191684690) (3:23)

If you use the morphological analyser, you should see predicted or suggested analyses. These suggested parses reveal what your lexicon and grammar currently allow for that word. If a suggested parse is wrong, it tells us that the grammatical area rules and lexicon need to be tightened up. The parser is only the engine, the accuracy of its results depends entirely on the content of your grammar and lexicon.

### Add a template

*In the Grammar area*, *Category Edit view*

-   Select the desired grammatical category
-   From the Insert menu choose Affix template
-   Type in a name for the template (e.g. Tense)
-   Use the context menu beside stem to insert slot after STEM

![](media/a80660a2bd581022f3d5d203017c7a7b.png)

-   Choose whether the slot is optional or obligatory

![](media/5c4404f672a11b83d74cd484a4c118f0.png)

-   Type a name for the slot

![](media/bac26b26f5e61c93d140e6b91d843989.png)

-   Then use the blue context menu to “Add inflectional morphemes to” this slot.
-   Click on the affixes that can fill the slot.
-   Click OK

![](media/ad9901d6397e525a7c1fd8b83d0a0222.png)

#### Start the parser
- Return to the Text & Words area,
- Choose the Word Analysis view
- From the Analyzer menu, choose **Analyze Current Word**. *The parser may take a few seconds to update*.

-   Go back to the Text & Words, Analysis view and start the parser, then click refresh to see the results. The invalid parse should not be produced.

::tip The invalid parse should not be produced because the new template excludes this particular combination of affixes.
:::


### 48 Try A Word (Testing Parser Output) (2:14) {#48}
[48 Try A Word (Testing Parser Output)**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/191684689) (2:14)

In the previous video, we saw that unconstrained allomorphs were part of the reason why invalid parses were suggested. Although adding the template stopped the invalid analysis, we did not prevent the two time affixes from being freely interchangeable with their normal forms. The Parser menu has a **Try Word** tool that lets you see how the grammar rules and lexicon parse words.

*In the Text and Words area*, *Word analyses view*.

#### Try a word
- From the Parser menu, choose Try a Word.
- Type the word you want to check
- Click **Try**. *The results show whether grammar rules prevent affixes from being parsed*.

#### Constrain the affix with environments
- Click on the affix (in the results)
- Drag the box out of view. *The allomorph is selected*.

#### Add an environment
**Either** type the environment in the field. **Or** click on the ellipsis button to see the existing environments. *The environment selection dialog box appears*. **Either** Click on the environments you need. **Click in front of Environment and choose **Check All**).
- Click **OK**.

#### Retest the word
- Return to the **Try Word** window,
- if necessary, type the word
- Click on **Try Word**. *The results are displayed. If successful, the analyses are not incorrect*.
- Try other words.

### 49 Concordance tools{#49}
[**49 Concordance**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/3123523/video/191683746) (1:42)

The concordance tool allows you to specify a string for the concordance tool to search on. You can also specify which line the string should occur in.

For more specific searches such as the specific entry or sense, use the show concordance commands which are on the right click menus on items you may want to concord on.

### Use concordance view

*In the Text & Words area*, *Concordance view*

-   Type in the text to search for
-   Specify the line to search in
-   Click **Search** *A concordance is displayed for any occurrence of the specified string.*

### Use the "show concordance" command

*In the Text & Words area*, *Concordance view*

-   Right-click an entry in the *Lex entry* line
-   Choose **Show concordance of**
-   Then choose **Entry**

![](media/196ff51321c8a5a23d9da828855d1229.png)

   *A concordance of just that entry is displayed, not a concordance of any occurrence of the specified string*.

:::tip

Only occurrences that have been approved are shown (not proposed occurrences).
